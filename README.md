## About <a name = "about"></a>

CLImate is a series of tools for creating understandable, easy to use, command line apps in Python.

The goal of CLImate is to have it handle I/O and some state so that users are aware of what is going on inside your script. While there are other libraries out there for making CLIs in Python, CLImate is aimed toward apps which require limited user interaction, rather, those which could benefit from updating the user as code executes. Rather than displaying a blank screen as execution is happening, apps will be able to keep the user informed and log events in a standard manner.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

CLImate is still incredibly under development, so there are no usage instructions for the library, however, you can check out the demo of the components thate are implemented or poke around in the source.
